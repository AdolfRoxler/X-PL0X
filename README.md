Crossin' yer roblocks gaym CUH


This is a debug tool intended to test a roblox game dev's laziness (hard work meter). Any misuse or catastrophe caused by this tool is at the responsibility of the end user. Not the developer. (hope mossad doesn't kill me!)


Todo list [not in order]:
-Optimization
-More customizability (idk maybe i make my own drawing lib)
-More protection features (I.E: sandboxed execution?)
-fix godmode (yeah gotta copy IY's code again! woohoo!)
