So this thing is well, as you expected, a simple lego game script. It mainly focuses on being a shadow, undetectable by the greatest measure while still being as full of features as it can be.


Todo list [not in order]:
-Aimbot (It's already done a long time)
-Add more features to ESP (ummm i gotta fix skeleton)
-More customizability (idk maybe i make my own drawing lib)
-More protection features (I.E: sandboxed execution?)
-fix godmode (yeah gotta copy IY's code again! woohoo!)




This is a debug tool intended to test a roblox game dev's laziness (hard work meter). Any misuse or catastrophe caused by this tool is at the responsibility of the end user. Not the developer. (hope mossad doesn't kill me!)
